# AutoPlug | The Idea
AutoPlug is meant to be that what all Server-Owners are waiting for. 
An easy to use interface to manage and update all of your Plugins! No more wasting time in searching links and changelogs!
All you want, all you need at one place.

# Plugin | Features
 - Collects each plugin name, author and version and sends the data to our server (the server then checks for updates via spiget-api).
 - Receives download link if there is an update available and downloads the jar file to /autoplug-cache.
 - Profile automatic: Deletes old jar file from /plugins and replaces it with the new one. Then the server is restarted.
 - or
 - Profile manual: No jars will be updated and the server wont restart. You will only get notified that there are updates available.
